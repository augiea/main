      <h2>Hogging The Tits</h2>
      <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="800" scrolling="no" src="https://www.redgifs.com/ifr/harmlessblackhoopoe" width="216"></iframe>
      <p>"Hey Al, how come you always get to be the big tit one?" Andre said as he sat on the beach in the body of Renee, a girl whose body he'd taken over using possession.com</p>
      <p>Because I can actually afford them. Plus, I was the one who told you about the site so I get first dibs.</p>
      <p>I just don't think it's fair. You get all the attention! I'm totally taking her over once your time is up.</p>
      <p>Whatever. Didn't hear you complaining last night when you were sucking them.</p>

      <h2>Thicker is Better</h2>
      <iframe src='https://www.redgifs.com/ifr/slategrayshallowcatbird' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='216' height='480'></iframe>
      <p>I'd taken over the body of a girl named Ally using the possession ring. She'd been super fit, but I decided to fatten her up and make her already sizeable tits even bigger.</p>
      <p>Some of the girls at her college had taken to calling me fat. I guess they were just pissed I'd fucked all their boyfriends. It was so easy, I'd just take their hands and mash them into my tits and they'd instantly break. This pussy felt so good stuffed with dick I didn't plan on stopping anytime soon.</p>
      <p>They could talk all they want, but when I looked down I saw my ever inflating jugs and knew I'd made the right call.</p>

      <h2>FirstPerson Fitness</h2>
      <iframe src='https://www.redgifs.com/ifr/costlyenormousshorebird' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='216' height='480'></iframe>
      <p>"So, these are the FirstPerson dolls you comissioned, Mr. Mollansky. Just like you specified, we've got one boy, one girl. Both versions of you in their mid-twenties. Will you be purchasing one or both today?"</p>
      <p>"They're a bit more pricy than expected, even for me." He said, examining the bodies that were currently inhabited by FirstPerson Corp's representatives. "Are the genitals... ahem ... fully realistic? Including sensation?"</p>
      <p>"Let me assure you Mr. Mollansky, if you didn't purchase the female doll and a woman were to inhabit it, she wouldn't be able to tell a difference between the sensations provided by her own erogenous zones and that of the doll's."</p>
      <p>"I'll take the female one, then." Mollansky said, imagining riding a dildo all night with that athletic body's stamina.</p>

      <h2>Bodyhopper Streamer</h2>
      <iframe src='https://www.redgifs.com/ifr/boringmoistmammoth' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='520' height='216'></iframe>
      <p>"So finishing the review of this body, last but not least, the tits are absolutely immaculate. Like, the biggest I've worn by far!"</p>
      <p>Carl was a middle aged bodyhopper and had gotten into the streaming game. He'd take over a new body, and after having some fun pinching his nipples and diddling his vagina he'd start a livestream reviewing it for his legion of loyal fans.</p>
      <p>"Yo! Looks like I've got a little admirer! I mean, who could blame him. These are some seriously fat tits and I'd get banned if I showed any more cleavage."</p>
      <p>"Oh look, a superchat! Yeah I agree, if I'm already getting this much attention I could totally pimp this body out for some serious cash."</p>
